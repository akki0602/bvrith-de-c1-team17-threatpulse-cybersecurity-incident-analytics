## 1. Sprint Goal

The goal of this week is to define the data dictionary and source schemas for the ChargeIQ project, covering raw, reference, Silver, and streaming data fields. We will also generate small synthetic sample datasets for development and testing while ensuring the data is structured, reproducible, and free of real personal or company data.
